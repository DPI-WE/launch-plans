# SAP - Associate Project Manager

## Day in a life

> "My day starts with reviewing emails and catching up on any updates from project stakeholders. After prioritizing urgent tasks, I usually meet with the Project Manager to review the financial forecast and ensure that our project expenses align with the budget. Resource management is a big part of my role, so I spend time tracking resource requests and making sure we have the right team members assigned to each project. Throughout the day, I manage financial trackers, approve timesheets, and work on processing change requests (CRs) to keep the project moving forward. I also collaborate with various teams to discuss project progress, address any roadblocks, and ensure we’re on track to meet our milestones. By the end of the day, I update the financial tracker, send out a status report to the Project Manager, and organize my task list for the next day, making sure we’re ready for the upcoming Go-Live."
