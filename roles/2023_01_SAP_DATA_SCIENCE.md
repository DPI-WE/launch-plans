# SAP - DATA SCIENCE

## Day in a Life:

> "I begin my day by overseeing ETL processes to ensure data is accurately integrated across various platforms. Once I’ve confirmed that all data is up-to-date, I focus on refreshing and managing SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) dashboards, along with Power BI and Excel reports, so that stakeholders have access to the latest insights. I frequently collaborate with the Data Warehouse Cloud team to troubleshoot access issues and make sure everyone has the data they need for smooth operations. In the afternoon, I dive into ad-hoc analyses, working with tools like SAC and Excel to forecast renewal rates and evaluate churn risks. I also make sure to review security measures, managing access and permissions to safeguard our data assets. Before wrapping up for the day, I create PowerPoint presentations summarizing my findings and insights to help guide decision-making. Lastly, I take a moment to plan out the next day’s tasks, ensuring everything is set for continued success."
