## Core responsibilities and competencies required

TA1 – Developers develop, integrate, testing, and maintain new and existing software applications. Knowing one or more programming languages and development methodologies, they exhibit high execution across our 6 engineering principles of continuous learning, holistic stewardship, experimentation, respect, the reduction of toil, and quality. Technical Associates are called upon to provide a variety of services in the course of their duties including, not but limited to:

- Designing, building, and testing highly scalable software applications or technical components
- Providing subject matter expertise to Application Reliability Engineering and Support (ARES)
- Contributing to product feature prioritization and technology roadmaps
- Supporting software applications as required for incident escalations
- Writing documentation as required for test plan development, support, knowledge transition, and release planning
- Identifying new technologies, trends, and opportunitites (at senior levels)
- Participating in sprint planning, design, coding, unit testing, and sprint reviews (at senior levels)
- Refining, challenging, and executing project requirements, functional specifications, and detailed designs of software solutions (at senior levels)

## Essential technical skills

This role will target individuals who have a focus on software design, architecture, and development.  These engineers will focus on implementation of Functional and Non Functional requirements through various programming languages that are used across our distributed systems.  Emphasis will be placed on functional performance, Service Level Agreements (SLAs), durability, and scalability.  This role will introduce and reinforce Enterprise Integration patterns and distributed cloud architecture. Focus of Technology Stack:

- One or more primary language focus Java, JavaScript, Scala, Dataweave, Node, Python, etc 
- One or more Framework focus Spring, React, Angular, MuleSoft, etc 
- One or more Integration Testing Frameworks Selenium, Cucumber, TestNG, Cypress, QTest, etc 
- One or more Load and Performance Testing Frameworks Jmeter, Cucumber, Gatling, etc 
- One or more development methodologies Agile, Scrum, XP, Kotlin, waterfall, etc

## Additional key skills and competencies

## Courses

- [Hyperskill: Introduction to Java](https://hyperskill.org/courses/8)
- I would highly recommend completing SQL course on Datacamp before beginning (or in parallel). Check out this [Hyperskill: Java Backend Developer (Spring Boot)](https://hyperskill.org/courses/12) course by JetBrains.
- [cs124](https://www.cs124.org/)[learncs.online](https://www.learncs.online/) is a Java (or Kotlin) based introduction to computer science course from University of Illinois. Great place to brush up on your computer science fundamentals in a new language.
- [Introduction to JavaScript from Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn-javascript-c0v). <br>
[They have a good deeper dive](https://scrimba.com/javascript-deep-dive-c0a), but it requires a subscription.

## Books

- [Spring in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/spring-in-action-sixth-edition)
- [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)

## Deliverables:

- Design and implement a scalable software application or component.
- Create technical documentation for the software design and architecture (eg Functional Requirements).
- Develop unit and integration tests.
- Conduct load and performance testing and document the results.
- Write documentation for deployment processes, incident management, and support procedures.
- Document and present a technology roadmap and feature prioritization plan.
