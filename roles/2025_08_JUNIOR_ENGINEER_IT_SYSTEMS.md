## Deliverables:

- End-to-End Network Setup, Troubleshooting, and Monitoring
- Design, configure, troubleshoot, and monitor a small virtual network using a network simulation tool (e.g., Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3) and a monitoring tool (e.g., Nagios). Set up basic IP addressing, routing, and VLANs***, simulate network traffic, resolve any connectivity issues, and generate a performance report from the monitoring data.

## Scope:

### Network Design & Configuration:

- Set up a small network with 2-3 routers, switches, and endpoints (PCs/Servers).
- Implement IP addressing and subnetting, ensuring each segment of the network is properly configured.
- Configure static routing or a dynamic routing protocol (e.g., OSPF).
- Create VLANs for network segmentation to improve security and performance.

### Troubleshooting & Testing:

- Simulate various network issues (e.g., incorrect IP configuration, routing loop, misconfigured VLAN) and troubleshoot using diagnostic tools like ping, traceroute, and netstat.
- Document the troubleshooting steps and solutions for each issue.

### Network Monitoring & Reporting:

- Install a network monitoring tool (e.g., Nagios or Zabbix) to monitor performance metrics like latency, packet loss, and throughput.
- Analyze logs and metrics to identify any performance bottlenecks or potential failures.
- Generate a performance report, including metrics analysis and recommendations for optimizing the network.

* CDR - Configuration Data Repository. A system or database where configuration information about network components (routers, switches, etc.) is stored and managed.
** CI - Configuration Item (commonly used in IT Service Management to refer to any component that needs to be managed in order to deliver an IT service).

*** VLAN - Virtual Local Area Network.

**** OSPF - Open Shortest Path First (a routing protocol).
