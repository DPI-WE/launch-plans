# John Deere - Software Engineer - JDEP Electrification Apprentice (Data Science + Embedded Systems Engineer) 

## Day in the Life

> "My role is a blend of data science and software engineering, where I primarily work with Electrical Engineers, Battery Management Systems Engineers, and Test Engineers. Each day, I act as a data scientist for the team, using a combination of programming, statistical analysis, and mathematical modeling to provide insights and solutions.

> Mornings typically begin with a team meeting to align on current projects and any challenges we’re facing. Following this, I might work on developing statistical models to analyze battery performance data or run simulations to predict outcomes under various conditions. For instance, I’ve used Python and SQL extensively to handle large datasets, applying statistical techniques such as regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and time series analysis to optimize data processing and visualization.

> Afternoons often involve collaborating with engineers to understand their data needs or to refine our models based on new test results. I spend significant time building and maintaining tools using Python, React, and Django that provide real-time data analysis and visualization, which are crucial for our battery management systems.

> I also lead sprint planning sessions, focusing on prioritizing tasks that provide the most value to our data-driven decision-making processes. My day often concludes with validating new algorithms or ensuring data accuracy for real-time systems."
